\begin{abstract}
    We introduce the technical design behind Fluidity Money, a yield generating protocol for people who cannot afford to leave their money idle. We construct such a system and compare it to previous works. Lastly, we highlight issues, alternative architectures and future extensions to the protocol.
    
    %{Fluidity Money tokens (Fluid Tokens) are a 1-to-1 wrapped asset that exposes holders to randomly paid large dividends. Dividends are paid out if the holder wins a lottery held on each transaction of the Fluid Token. Fluidity Money exposes users, who could not ordinarily afford to leave their money idle, to decentralised finance.%}
