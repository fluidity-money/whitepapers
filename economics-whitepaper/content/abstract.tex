\begin{abstract}
    Fluidity Money tokens (Fluid Assets) are a 1-to-1 wrapped asset that exposes holders to randomly paid large dividend rewards. Dividends are paid out according to a drawing mechanism held on each transaction of their Fluid Assets. Dividends are generated by the cumulative yield created by every principal token deposited and lent on money markets.
