\subsection{PoolTogether \cite{pool}}

PoolTogether takes principal amounts from users and lends that amount on lending networks generating yield. This yield, much like Fluidity, is used to represent the "prize pool". This prize pool is randomly paid to winners of a lottery held at intervals with chances of winning proportionate to the amount initially deposited.

This approach is conducted entirely on-chain, with users depositing their amounts into a contract. This amount is left idle and the prize contract is called after a fixed interval to select winners.
